    "1. This is a take-home exam.\n",
    "2. You are expected to complete and submit the exam by 27 - May - 2020, 15:00 GMT\n",
    "   + No late submissions will be allowed.\n",
    "   + Submit your exam through canvas.\n",
    "3. The exam is in English and you are expected to complete it in English.\n",
    "4. The exam requires coding and you are expected to code in Python 3.0.\n",
    "5. The exam is worth 100 points, and it will constitute 50% of your grade.\n",
    "6. To pass the course you need to obtain at least 50 points in this exam (and a 5.5 overall course grade)\n",
    "7. The exam describes a problem you will need to solve.\n",
    "8. This is an open-ended problem, which means that\n",
    "   + there is no single perfect solution, however \n",
    "   + there are still correct and incorrect things one may do, and\n",
    "   + there are certain best practices to follow.\n",
    "9. You are expected to complete this exam on your own. \n",
    "   + You are not allowed to discuss or share the exam, or share your solutions with anyone else.\n",
    "   + We run a plagiarism check both against the web and against all submitted exams. \n",
    "   + There are different ways to work on this problem. It would really be a coincidence if 2 students choose very similar way of solving it; if that is the case, we will take a closer look and we will invite the students to a short oral examination/discussion over their solutions.\n",
    "10. We will spend approximately 15 minutes to assess your work. So make sure that everything looks clear, is neatly documented, and that everything runs.\n",
    "11. You are allowed to import from the following APIs: sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, nltk. You are not allowed to use any other API."

    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You are provided with a dataset of Airbnb listings for apartments in Amsterdam. Download the data to the same folder as this ipynb file.\n",
    "2. Each row in the listings corresponds to an appartment, and each column to an attribute/feature for that appartment.\n",
    "3. One of the attributes is the *price* of the apartment. Based on the actual price listings are split into two categories, *cheap* and *expensive*, which is the value of the attribute *price*.\n",
    "4. Your goal is to \n",
    "  1. classify listings into cheap and expensive by the means of machine learning, \n",
    "  2. discuss the quality of your classifier in terms of appropriate evaluation measures, using tables or plots for comparisons, and \n",
    "  3. compare it to a naive classifier.\n",
    "5. You can use numerical, categorical, and textual features you think can help, or derive features of your own from existing ones,  apply the right treatment to them, and build some simple classifiers over them. You should not use the features *neighborhood*, *longitude* and *latitude* (see point 6.).\n",
    "6. Two of the features are the *longitude* and the *latitude* of the apartment. Together these two numbers tell you the precise location of a listing in Amsterdam. You should use  these two numbers, but you are not allowed to use them directly. Instead, you are expected to cluster listings, based on these two numbers, into a number of clusters/neightborhoods, and use the neighborhood cluster as a feature.\n",
    "7. You must demonstrate that you are constructing the best possible classifier, that is you should run all those experiments needed to persuade us that you have achieved optimal performance, using everything that you were taught by this class.\n",
    "8. You are expected to explain what are you doing at every step and argue about your choices on the basis of the course."
